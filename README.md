## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers in India, a multilingual, AI-powered mobile advisory platform can be developed to deliver personalized, real-time agricultural guidance. This solution would integrate soil health analysis, weather-based alerts, crop selection support, and pest detection through image uploads, all tailored to the farmer’s location and crop history. Voice-enabled features would ensure accessibility for low-literate users, while market price tracking and predictive insights would help optimize input costs and maximize yield. By combining scientific data with local language support and intuitive design, the platform would empower farmers to make informed decisions, reduce dependency on unreliable sources, and promote sustainable farming practices—ultimately improving livelihoods, food security, and environmental health.

## Technical Approach
The technical approach involves building a multilingual, AI-powered mobile platform that integrates multiple data sources and intelligent modules to deliver personalized agricultural advisory. The system would use machine learning models trained on agronomic datasets to provide crop recommendations, fertilizer guidance, and pest diagnosis via image recognition. A geospatial engine would process satellite and weather data to generate hyperlocal alerts and predictive insights. Natural language processing (NLP) would enable voice-based interaction and translation across regional languages, ensuring accessibility for low-literate users. Cloud infrastructure would support real-time data processing, scalability, and secure feedback collection, while APIs would connect to market price databases and government schemes. The app would be designed with an intuitive interface, offline capabilities, and modular architecture to allow easy updates and integration with local agri-tech ecosystems.

## Feasibility and Viability
The feasibility of developing a multilingual, AI-powered agri-advisory platform is high due to the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile internet in rural India, along with advancements in AI, natural language processing, and satellite data integration. Existing technologies like image recognition for pest detection, hyperlocal weather forecasting, and voice-based interfaces are mature enough to be adapted for agricultural use. Viability is also strong, as the solution aligns with national priorities like Digital India and PM-Kisan, and can be supported through partnerships with government agencies, NGOs, and agri-tech startups. With over 86% of farmers being small or marginal, the market potential is vast, and the social impact—improved yields, reduced costs, and sustainable practices—makes it attractive for public and private investment.

## Impact and Benefits
The impact of a multilingual, AI-powered agri-advisory platform for small and marginal farmers in India would be transformative across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. By enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions on crop selection, pest control, and input usage, the solution can significantly increase crop yields—by up to 30%—and reduce input costs, directly improving household income and food security. It empowers farmers with scientific knowledge in their native language, reducing dependence on unreliable advice and fostering self-reliance. Environmentally, it promotes sustainable practices by curbing the overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, preserving soil health and biodiversity. Socially, it bridges the digital divide through voice support and intuitive design, enhancing digital literacy and inclusion. Overall, the platform strengthens rural resilience, supports climate-smart agriculture, and contributes to national goals of doubling farmer income and achieving sustainable development.
